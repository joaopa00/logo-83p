# Summer 2007 Tentative Schedule #

  * **May 28: Start of Coding**

  * May 28 - June 1: Low-level memory management routines -- allocating nodes and objects; setting up an empty "workspace."

  * June 2 - 8: Higher-level routines for creating and manipulating various types of data.  Also, routines for managing the interpreter stack.

  * June 9 - 15: Beginning the parser.  Nothing fancy yet -- no arrays, no numbers, no symbols -- but it should be able to read an input string and parse it into a list containing lists and strings.

  * June 16 - 22: Testing and enhancing the parser.  Writing a basic PRINT function so we can have our "read-...-print-loop".

  * June 23 - 29: Obarray (symbol table) management routines.  If time permits, I'll start the garbage collector.

  * **June 30 - July 7:** I'm on vacation!  No code!  Bah!

  * **July 9: SOC Mid-term deadline:** the basic infrastructure should be functional, and I'll have a very simple demo to show off the parser.

  * July 8 - 15: Beginning the evaluator.  Only primitives at this point, and nothing with a variable number of arguments.

  * July 16 - 22: Adding user procedures to the evaluator.  We can define them using the primitive DEFINE.

  * July 23 - 29: Writing more primitives and library functions.  Probably focusing on math, list manipulation, and control primitives.

  * July 30 - August 5: Writing still more primitives and library functions.  Probably focusing on I/O, textual and graphical.  And improving the GUI.

  * August 6 - 12: Writing file I/O primitives, thus allowing users to load and save program files.  Adding TO syntax.

  * August 13 - 19: Other things as I have time: improving the garbage collector, adding fancier interpreter features, writing more primitives.

  * **August 20: Final SOC project deadline!**

  * August 23: Classes start!  Yay!  But the project goes on.
